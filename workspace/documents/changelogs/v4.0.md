# Changelog v4.0

## New Features

- **Kotlin SDK**: Official SDK for Kotlin and Java, replacing the deprecated Java SDK.
- **WebSocket streaming**: Real-time event stream via `wss://stream.datastack.io` as an alternative to webhooks.
- **Per-endpoint rate limits**: Enterprise customers can now configure different rate limits for different API endpoints.
- **JSON column queries**: New `->` and `->>` operators for querying nested JSON data.
- **Scheduled reports**: Send dashboard snapshots as PDF emails on a recurring schedule.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an edge case where concurrent bulk imports could cause duplicate rows.
- Fixed webhook signature validation failing when the payload contained Unicode characters.
- Fixed the query builder not supporting `BETWEEN` operator for date columns.
- Fixed alert escalation not triggering when the primary notification channel was down.

## Breaking Changes

# Changelog v3.0

## New Features

- **Approximate aggregations**: `approx_count_distinct()` and `approx_percentile()` for 10x faster queries on large datasets.
- **Window functions**: Full support for SQL window functions including `ROW_NUMBER`, `LAG`, `LEAD`, and `NTILE`.
- **Public dashboards**: Share dashboards via public URLs without requiring authentication.
- **Bulk import API**: New `/api/v1/import/bulk` endpoint for loading large datasets efficiently.
- **Query builder**: Visual query builder in the dashboard for constructing queries without writing SQL.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed webhook retry policy not respecting the configured backoff intervals.
- Fixed dashboard auto-refresh consuming excessive API quota.
- Fixed query timeout not being enforced for queries running in background jobs.
- Fixed SDK connection pooling leaking connections on HTTP errors.

## Breaking Changes

- Minimum Python SDK version is now 2.0.0. The 1.x SDK is no longer supported.
- The `/auth/*` endpoints (deprecated in v2.0) have been removed. Use `/api/v1/auth/*`.
- Rate limit headers now use standard `RateLimit-*` prefix instead of `X-RateLimit-*`. Both are returned during the transition period.

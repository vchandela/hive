# Changelog v2.0

## New Features

- **Webhook support**: Configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications for query completions, alerts, and data imports.
- **Two-factor authentication**: Added 2FA support for enhanced account security. Authentication tokens now support scoped permissions.
- **Node.js SDK**: Official SDK for Node.js with TypeScript definitions.
- **Scheduled imports**: Automate recurring data imports from S3, GCS, or HTTP endpoints.
- **Alert escalation**: Configure multi-level escalation policies for critical alerts.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where query results with null values caused the dashboard widget to crash.
- Fixed rate limit headers not being included in error responses.
- Fixed CSV import failing silently on files with BOM markers.
- Fixed authentication token validation accepting expired tokens for up to 5 minutes after revocation.

## Breaking Changes

- The `/api/v1/query` response format has changed: `results` is now `data` and `meta` is now `metadata`. Update your API clients accordingly.
- Authentication endpoints moved from `/auth/*` to `/api/v1/auth/*`. The old authentication paths will be removed in v3.0.
